# import the Elasticsearch public GPG key into APT
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

# add the Elastic source list to the sources.list.d directory, where APT will look for new sources:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list

# update your package lists so APT will read the new Elastic source:
sudo apt update
