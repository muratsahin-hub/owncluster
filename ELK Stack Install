# import the Elasticsearch public GPG key into APT
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

# add the Elastic source list to the sources.list.d directory, where APT will look for new sources:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list

# update your package lists so APT will read the new Elastic source:
sudo apt update

# Install Elasticsearch
sudo apt install elasticsearch

# Once Elasticsearch is finished installing, edit Elasticsearch’s main configuration file,
sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

# Elasticsearch listens for traffic from everywhere on port 9200.
# You will want to restrict outside access to your Elasticsearch instance to prevent outsiders
# from reading your data or shutting down your Elasticsearch cluster through the REST API.
# Find the line that specifies network.host, uncomment it, and replace its value with localhost so it looks like this:
# /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
# . . .
# network.host: localhost
# . . .
# Save and close elasticsearch.yml by pressing CTRL+X, followed by Y and then ENTER.
# N/A after a version, you can skip if you don't see the line specified above.

# Start the Elasticsearch service with systemctl:
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

# Check the installation with the command below. Everything is ok if you see a green dot.
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

# Run the following command to enable Elasticsearch to start up every time your server boots:
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch

# You can test whether your Elasticsearch service is running by sending an HTTP request:
curl -X GET "localhost:9200"

# You will see a response showing some basic information about your local node, similar to this:
#
# Output
# {
#   "name" : "ZlJ0k2h",
#   "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
#   "cluster_uuid" : "beJf9oPSTbecP7_i8pRVCw",
#   "version" : {
#     "number" : "6.4.2",
#     "build_flavor" : "default",
#     "build_type" : "deb",
#     "build_hash" : "04711c2",
#     "build_date" : "2018-09-26T13:34:09.098244Z",
#     "build_snapshot" : false,
#     "lucene_version" : "7.4.0",
#     "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
#     "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
#   },
#   "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
# }
 
# Now that Elasticsearch is up and running, let’s install Kibana, the next component of the Elastic Stack.
sudo apt install kibana

# Enable Kibana service:
sudo systemctl enable kibana

# Start Kibana service:
sudo systemctl start kibana

# You can reach Kibana with localhost:5601

# Install Logstash 
sudo apt install logstash

# Create a configuration file
sudo nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/30-elasticsearch-output.conf

# Test Logstash, if you "Configuration OK" then you should be ok.
sudo -u logstash /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash --path.settings /etc/logstash -t
