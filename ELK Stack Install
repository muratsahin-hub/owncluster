# import the Elasticsearch public GPG key into APT
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

# add the Elastic source list to the sources.list.d directory, where APT will look for new sources:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list

# update your package lists so APT will read the new Elastic source:
sudo apt update

# Install Elasticsearch
sudo apt install elasticsearch

# Once Elasticsearch is finished installing, edit Elasticsearchâ€™s main configuration file,
sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

# Elasticsearch listens for traffic from everywhere on port 9200.
# You will want to restrict outside access to your Elasticsearch instance to prevent outsiders
# from reading your data or shutting down your Elasticsearch cluster through the REST API.
# Find the line that specifies network.host, uncomment it, and replace its value with localhost so it looks like this:
# /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
# . . .
# network.host: localhost
# . . .
# Save and close elasticsearch.yml by pressing CTRL+X, followed by Y and then ENTER.
# N/A after a version, you can skip if you don't see the line specified above.

# Start the Elasticsearch service with systemctl:
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

# Check the installation with the command below. Everything is ok if you see a green dot.
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
